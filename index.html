    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>What is it?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Essentially a Steam&trade; Machine is any computer running SteamOS&trade;. SteamOS&trade; is a Linux operating system designed by Valve&trade; to run in the living room on your TV.
        </p>
        <p>
          Controlled via a gamepad a Steam&trade; Machine is a more viable solution to gaming in your front room than a Windows&trade; PC controlled via a keyboard and mouse.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>What is Steam&trade;?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Think of Steam as the iTunes&trade; and Facebook&trade; of video games. A digital library that stores all the games and software you have ever purchased, accessible anywhere in the world on any machine you log in to. With thousands of titles available and many more being added every week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steam&trade; can store your screenshots and in-game video. It can help you connect with you friends to play together, chat together and share content.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Why would I want one?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Steam&trade; has existed for over a decade with over ¾ of PC game purchases occurring on the platform. Valve&trade; the creators of Steam&trade; are also responsible for many successful games franchises including Half-Life&trade;, Portal&trade; and Counter Strike&trade;. They know what they are doing and are the perfect company to take PC gaming into the living room. With AAA publishers and Indie game developers alike releasing their content on Steam&trade;, there are plenty of titles to suit the desires of all gamers
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike traditional consoles, Steam&trade; Machines are capable of using your televisions full 1080p resolution and 60hz refresh rate. Utilising their greater processing and graphics capabilities Steam&trade; Machines will make your games appear sharper and more detailed.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>Why does it cost more than a console?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          It doesn't have to. Our base machine is priced to compete with the consoles, with the lowest price model launching at the same price Micrsosoft's&trade; Xbox One&trade; launched at.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sony&trade; and Microsoft&trade; have traditionally treated consoles as “loss leaders”, utilising a strategy known as “razors and razor blades”. What this means is they sell the consoles (razors) at below cost, losing money, but make a profit on the games (razor blades). This strategy works as they make a royalty of between &dollar;5 and &dollar;7 for every game they sell. In addition to this, they make money from membership to their premium online services, typically between £30 to £40 a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you purchase a Steam&trade; Machine your initially outlay is higher, but you will recoup this very quickly due to lower game prices and no premium subscription fees. 
        </p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Isn't PC gaming too complicated?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          PCs have come a long way in the last few years and with the introduction of SteamOS&trade; things will only get easier. Our machines are designed to play all of the latest games, so no need to fret about recommended hardware requirements and incompatibility issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Games can be downloaded via Steam&trade; and installed within seconds all at the push of a button. The ease of PC gaming is now on a par with the consoles.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>I can't see what I want on the site, can you make me something different?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Our philosophy is that the you are the boss. If you have a specific hardware requirement or desperately want a pink case, we will do our best to accommodate you. We love doing customs builds and can't wait to create you something special! Requests for overclocked and water-cooled machines can be accommodated, but the extra work will require a longer build time.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>I've seen a &dollar;6000 Steam&trade; Machine online, why don't yours cost that much?</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          PCs have an almost limitless array of options to cater for the needs of all consumers. Some manufacturers have chosen to go overkill with these machines utilising hardware designed for the latest generation 4K screens. Most people buying a Steam&trade; Machine will be using it with a 1080p TV screen and won't need anything near as expensive to experience SteamOS&trade; in all its glory. We have designed our machines with this in mind. However if you've got the cash to throw at it and want a machine that can handle Eyefinity&trade; on 4K screens contact us and we will build you something really special!
